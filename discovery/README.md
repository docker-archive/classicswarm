# Contribute a new discovery backend

Docker Swarm comes with multiple Discovery backends. To read the end-user
documentation, visit the [Swarm discovery documentation on
docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/discovery/). If you want to
modify the discovery end-user documentation, start with [the `docs/discovery.md`
file](https://github.com/docker/swarm/blob/master/docs/discovery.md) in this
project.
