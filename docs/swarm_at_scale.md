# Try Swarm at scale

Using this example, you'll deploy a voting application on a Swarm cluster. The
example walks you through creating a Swarm cluster and deploying the application
against the cluster. This walk through is intended to illustrate one example of
a typical development process.

After building and manually deploying the voting application, you'll construct a
Docker Compose file. You (or others) can use the file to deploy and scale the
application further. The article also provides a troubleshooting section you can
use while developing or deploying the voting application.


## About the example

Your company is a pet food company that has bought an commercial during the
Superbowl. The commercial drives viewers to a web survey that asks users to vote &ndash; cats or dogs. You are developing the web survey. Your survey must ensure that
millions of people can vote concurrently without your website becoming
unavailable. You don't need real-time results, a company press release announces
the results. However, you do need confidence that every vote is counted.

The example assumes you are deploying the application to a Docker Swarm cluster
running on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is an example only. There is
nothing about this application or deployment that requires it. You could deploy
the application to a Docker Swarm cluster running on; a different cloud provider
such as Microsoft Azure, on premises in your own physical data center, or in a
development environment on your laptop.

The example requires you to perform the following high-level steps:

- [Deploy your infrastructure](#deploy-your-infrastructure)
- [Create the Swarm cluster](#create-the-swarm-cluster)
- [Overlay a container network on the cluster](#overlay-a-container-network-on-the-cluster)
- [Deploy the voting application](#deploy-the-voting-application)
- [Test the application](#test-the-application)

Before working through the sample, make sure you understand the application and Swarm cluster architecture.

### Application architecture

The voting application is a Dockerized microservice application. It uses a
parallel web frontend that sends jobs to asynchronous background workers. The
application's design can accommodate arbitrarily large scale. The diagram below
shows the high level architecture of the application.

![](images/app-architecture.jpg)

The application is fully Dockerized with all services running inside of
containers.

The frontend consists of an Interlock load balancer with *n* frontend web
servers and associated queues. The load balancer can handle an arbitrary number
of web containers behind it (`frontend01`- `frontendN`). The web containers run
a simple Python Flask application. Each container accepts votes and queues them
to a Redis container on the same node. Each web container and Redis queue pair
operates independently.  

The load balancer together with the independent pairs allows the entire
application to scale to an arbitrary size as needed to meet demand.

Behind the frontend is a worker tier which runs on separate nodes. This tier:

* scans the Redis containers
* dequeues votes
* deduplicates votes to prevent double voting
* commits the results to a Postgres container running on a separate node

Just like the front end, the worker tier can also scale arbitrarily.

### Swarm Cluster Architecture

To support the application the design calls for a Swarm cluster that with a single Swarm manager and 4 nodes as shown below.

![](images/swarm-cluster-arch.jpg)

All four nodes in the cluster are running the Docker daemon, as is the Swarm
manager and the Interlock load balancer. The Swarm manager exists on a Docker
host that is not part of the cluster and is considered out of band for the
application. The Interlock load balancer could be placed inside of the cluster,
but for this demonstration it is not.

The diagram below shows the application architecture overlayed on top of the
Swarm cluster architecture. After completing the example and deploying your
application, this is what your environment should look like.

![](images/final-result.jpg)

As the previous diagram shows, each node in the cluster runs the following containers:

- `frontend01`:
    - Container: Pyhton flask web app (frontend01)
    - Container: Redis (redis01)
- `frontend02`:
    - Container: Python flask web app (frontend02)
    - Container: Redis (redis02)
- `worker01`: vote worker app (worker01)
- `store`:
    - Container: Postgres (pg)
    - Container: results app (results-app)

## Deploy your infrastructure

As previously stated, this article will walk you through deploying the
application to a Swam cluster in an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). However,
you can reproduce the environment design on whatever platform you wish. For
example, you could place the application on another public cloud platform such
as DigitalOcean, on premises in your data center, or even in in a test
environment on your laptop.

Deploying the AWS infrastructure requires that you first build the VPC and then
apply apply the [CloudFormation
template](https://github.com/docker/swarm-demo-voting-app/blob/master/AWS/cloudformation.json).
While you cloud create the entire VPC and all instances via a CloudFormation
template, splitting the deployment into two steps allows the CloudFormation
template to be easily used to build instances in *existing VPCs*.

The diagram below shows the VPC infrastructure required to run the
CloudFormation template.

![](images/cloud-formation-tmp.jpg)

The AWS configuration is a single VPC with a single public subnet. The VPC must
be in the `us-west-1` Region (N. California). This Region is required for this
particular CloudFormation template to work. The VPC network address space is
`192.168.0.0/16` and single 24-bit public subnet is carved out as
192.168.33.0/24. The subnet must be configured with a default route to the
internet via the VPC's internet gateway. All 6 EC2 instances are deployed into
this public subnet.

Once the VPC is created you can deploy the EC2 instances using the
CloudFormation template located
[here](https://github.com/docker/swarm-demo-voting-app/blob/master/AWS/cloudformation.json).

>**Note**: If you are not deploying to AWS, or are not using the CloudFormation template mentioned above, make sure your Docker hosts are running a 3.16 or higher kernel. This kernel is required by Docker's container networking feature.

### Step 1. Build and configure the VPC

This step assumes you know [how to configure a VPC](link here) either manually
or using the VPC wizard on Amazon. You can build the VPC manually or by using
using the VPC Wizard. If you use the wizard, be sure to choose the **VPC with a
Single Public Subnet** option.

Configure your VPC with the following values:

- **Region**: N. California (us-west-1)
- **VPC Name**: Swarm-scale
- **VPC Network (CIDR)**: 192.168.0.0/16
    - **DNS resolution**: Yes
- **Subnet name**: PublicSubnet
    - **Subnet type**: Public (with route to the internet)
    - **Subnet network (CIDR)**: 192.168.33.0/24
    - **Auto-assign public IP**: Yes
    - **Availability Zone**: Any
- **Router**: A single router with a route for *local* traffic and default route for traffic to the internet
- **Internet gateway**: A single internet gateway used as default route for the subnet's routing table

You'll configure the remaining AWS settings in the next section as part of the
CloudFormation template.


### Step 2. Apply the CloudFormation template

Before you can apply the CloudFormation template, you will need to have created
a VPC as per instructions in the previous section. You will also need access to
the private key of an EC2 KeyPair associated with your AWS account in the
`us-west-1` Region. Follow the steps below to build the remainder of the AWS
infrastructure using the CloudFormation template.

1. Choose **Create Stack** from the CloudFormation page in the AWS Console
2. Click the **Choose file** button under the **Choose a template** section
3. Select the **swarm-scale.json** CloudFormation template available from the [application's GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker/swarm-demo-voting-app/blob/master/AWS/cloudformation.json)
4. Click **Next**
5. Give the Stack a name. You can name the stack whatever you want, though it is recommended to use a meaningful name
6. Select a KeyPair form the dropdown list
7. Select the correct **Subnetid** (PublicSubnet) and **Vpcid** (SwarmCluster) from the dropdowns
8. Click **Next**
9. Click **Next** again
10. Review your settings and click **Create**
    AWS displays the progress of your stack being created

### Step 3. Check your deployment

When completed, the CloudFormation populates your VPC with the following six EC2 instances:

- `manager`:     t2.micro  / 192.168.33.11
- `interlock`:   t2.micro  / 192.168.33.12
- `frontend01`:  t2.micro  / 192.168.33.20
- `frontend02`:  t2.micro  / 192.168.33.21
- `worker01`:    t2.micro  / 192.168.33.200
- `store`:       m3.medium / 192.168.33.250

Your AWS infrastructure should look like this.

![](images/aws-infrastructure.jpg)

All instances are based on the `ami-56f59e36` AMI. This is an Ubuntu 14.04
image with a 3.16 kernel and 1.9.1 of the Docker Engine installed. It also has
the following parameters added to the `DOCKER_OPTS` line in
`/etc/default/docker`:

```
--cluster-store=consul://192.168.33.11:8500 --cluster-advertise=eth0:2375 -H=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H=unix:///var/run/docker.sock\
```

Once your stack is created successfully you are ready to progress to the next
step and build the Swarm cluster. From this point, the instructions refer to the
AWS EC2 instances as "nodes".

## Create the Swarm cluster

Now that your underlying network infrastructure is built, you are ready to build and configure the Swarm cluster.

### Step 1: Construct the cluster

The steps below construct a Swarm cluster by:

* using Consul as the discovery backend
* join the `frontend`, `worker`
* `store` EC2 instances to the cluster
* use the `spread` scheduling strategy.

Perform all of the following commands from the `manager` node.

1. Start a new Consul container that listens on TCP port 8500

        $ sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d -p 8500:8500 -h consul progrium/consul -server -bootstrap

    This starts a Consul container for use as the Swarm discovery service. This
    backend is also used as the K/V store for the container network that you
    overlay on the Swarm cluster in a later step.

2. Start a Swarm manager container.

    This command maps port 3375 on the `manager` node to port 2375 in the
    Swarm manager container

        $ sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d -p 3375:2375 swarm manage consul://192.168.33.11:8500/

    This Swarm manager container is the heart of your Swarm cluster. It is
    responsible for receiving all Docker commands sent to the cluster, and for
    scheduling resources against the cluster. In a real-world production
    deployment you would configure additional replica Swarm managers as
    secondaries for high availability (HA).

3. Set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable.

    This ensures that the default endpoint for Docker commands is the Docker daemon running on the `manager` node

        $ export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.33.11:3375"

4. While still on the `manager` node, join the nodes to the cluster.

    You can run these commands form the `manager` node because the `-H` flag
    sends the commands to the Docker daemons on the nodes. The command joins a
    node to the cluster and registers it with the Consul discovery service.

        sudo docker -H=tcp://<node-private-ip>:2375 run -d swarm join --advertise=<node-private-ip>:2375 consul://192.168.33.11:8500/

    Substitute `<node-private-ip` in the command with the private IP of the
    you are adding. Repeat step 4 for every node you are adding to the cluster -
    `frontend01`, `frontend02`, `worker01`, and `store`.


### Step 2: Review your work

The diagram below shows the Swarm cluster that you created.

![](images/review-work.jpg)

The diagram shows the `manager` node is running two containers: `consul` and
`swarm`. The `consul` container is providing the Swarm discovery service. This
is where nodes and services register themselves and discover each other. The
`swarm` container is running the `swarm manage` process which makes it act as
the cluster manager. The manager is responsible for accepting Docker commands
issued against the cluster and scheduling resources on the cluster.

You mapped port 3375 on the `manager` node to port 2375 inside the `swarm`
container. As a result, Docker clients (for example the CLI) wishing to issue
commands against the cluster must send them to the `manager` node on port
3375. The `swarm` container then executes those commands against the relevant
node(s) in the cluster over port 2375.

Now that you have your Swarm cluster configured, you'll overlay the container
network that the application containers will be part of.

## Overlay a container network on the cluster

All containers that are part of the voting application belong to a container
network called `mynet`. This will be an overlay network that allows all
application containers to easily communicate irrespective of the underlying
network that each node is on.

### Step 1: Create the network

You can create the network and join the containers from any node in your VPC
that is running Docker Engine. However, best practice when using Docker Swarm is
to execute commands from the `manager` node, as this is where all management
tasks happen.

1. Open a terminal on your `manager` node.
2. Create the overlay network with the `docker network` command

        $ sudo docker network create --driver overlay mynet

    An overlay container network is visible to all Docker daemons that use the
    same discovery backend. As all Swarm nodes in your environment are
    configured to use the Consul discovery service at
    `consul://192.168.33.11:8500`, they all should see the new overlay network.
    Verify this with the next step.

3. Log onto each node in your Swarm cluster and verify the `mynet` network is running.

        $ sudo docker network ls
        NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
        72fa20d0663d        mynet               overlay
        bd55c57854b8        host                host
        25e34427f6ff        bridge              bridge
        8eee5d2130ab        none                null

    You should see an entry for the `mynet` network using the `overlay` driver as shown above.

### Step 2: Review your work

The diagram below shows the complete cluster configuration including the overlay
container network, `mynet`. The `mynet` is shown as red and is available to all
Docker hosts using the Consul discovery backend. Later in the procedure you will
connect containers to this network.

![](images/overlay-review.jpg)

> **Note**: The `swarm` and `consul` containers on the `manager` node are not attached to the `mynet` overlay network.

Your cluster is now built and you are ready to build and run your application on
it.

## Deploy the voting application

Now it's time to configure the application.

Some of the containers in the application are launched from custom images you
must build. Others are launched form existing images pulled directly from Docker
Hub. Deploying the application requires that you:

- Understand the custom images
- Build custom images
- Pull stock images from Docker Hub
- Launch application containers

### Step 1: Understand the custom images

The list below shows which containers use custom images and which do not:

- Web containers: custom built image
- Worker containers: custom built image
- Results containers: custom built image
- Load balancer container: stock image (`ehazlett/interlock`)
- Redis containers: stock image (official `redis` image)
- Postgres (PostgreSQL) containers: stock image (official `postgres` image)

All custom built images are built using Dockerfile's pulled from the [application's public GitHub repository](https://github.com/docker/swarm-demo-voting-app).

1. Log into the Swarm manager node.
2. Clone the [application's GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker/swarm-demo-voting-app)

        $ sudo git clone https://github.com/docker/swarm-demo-voting-app

    This command creates a new directory structure inside of your working
    directory. The new directory contains all of the files and folders required
    to build the voting application images.

    The `AWS` directory contains the `cloudformation.json` file used to deploy
    the EC2 instances. The `Vagrant` directory contains files and instructions
    required to deploy the application using Vagrant. The `results-app`,
    `vote-worker`, and `web-vote-app` directories contain the Dockerfiles and
    other files required to build the custom images for those particular
    components of the application.


3. Change directory into the `swarm-demo-voting-app/web-vote-app` directory and inspect the contents of the `Dockerfile`

        $ cd swarm-demo-voting-app/web-vote-app/

        $ cat Dockerfile
        FROM python:2.7
        WORKDIR /app
        ADD requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
        RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
        ADD . /app
        EXPOSE 80
        CMD ["python", "app.py"]

    As you can see, the image is based on the official `Python:2.7` tagged
    image, adds a requirements file into the `/app` directory, installs
    requirements, copies files from the build context into the container,
    exposes port `80` and tells the container which command to run.

### Step 2. Build custom images

1. Log into the swarm manager node if you haven't already.
2. Change to the root of your swarm-demo-voting app clone.

2. Build the `web-votes-app` image on `frontend01` and `frontend02`

        $ sudo docker -H tcp://192.168.33.20:2375 build -t web-vote-app ./web-vote-app
        $ sudo docker -H tcp://192.168.33.21:2375 build -t web-vote-app ./web-vote-app

    These commands build the  `web-vote-app` image on the `frontend01` and
    `frontend02` nodes. To accomplish the operation, each command copies the
    contents of the `swarm-demo-voting-app/web-vote-app` sub-directory from the
    `manager` node to each frontend node. The command then instructs the
    Docker daemon on each frontend node to build the image and store it locally.

    It may take a minute or so for each image to build. Wait for the builds to finish.

3. Build `vote-worker` image on the `worker01` node

        $ sudo docker -H tcp://192.168.33.200:2375 build -t vote-worker ./vote-worker

    It may take a minute or so for the image to build. Wait for the build to finish.

5. Build the `results app` on the `store` node

        $ sudo docker -H tcp://192.168.33.250:2375 build -t results-app ./results-app

Each of the *custom images* required by the application is now built and stored locally on the nodes that will use them.

### Step 3. Pull stock images from Docker Hub

For performance reasons, it is always better to pull any required Docker Hub images locally on each instance that needs them. This ensures that containers based on those images can start quickly.

1. Log into the Swarm `manager` node.

2. Pull the `redis` image to `frontend01` and `frontend02`

        $ sudo docker -H tcp://192.168.33.20:2375 pull redis
        $ sudo docker -H tcp://192.168.33.21:2375 pull redis

2. Pull the `postgres` image to the `store` node

        $ sudo docker -H tcp://192.168.33.250:2375 pull postgres

3. Pull the `ehazlett/interlock` image to the `interlock` node

        $ sudo docker -H tcp://192.168.33.12:2375 pull ehazlett/interlock

Each node in the cluster, as well as the `interlock` node, now has the required images stored locally as shown below.

![](images/interlock.jpg)

Now that all images are built, pulled, and stored locally, the next step is to start the application.

### Step 4. Start the voting application

The following steps will guide you through the process of starting the application

* Start the `interlock` load balancer container on `interlock`
* Start the `redis` containers on `frontend01` and `frontend02`
* Start the `web-vote-app` containers on `frontend01` and `frontend02`
* Start the `postgres` container on `store`
* Start the `worker` container on `worker01`
* Start the `results-app` container on `store`

Do the following:

1. Log into the Swarm `manager` node.

2. Start the `interlock` container on the `interlock` node

        $ sudo docker -H tcp://192.168.33.12:2375 run --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:80 --name interlock -d ehazlett/interlock --swarm-url tcp://192.168.33.11:3375 --plugin haproxy start

    This command is issued against the `interlock` instance and maps port 80 on the instance to port 80 inside the container. This allows the container to load balance connections coming in over port 80 (HTTP). The command also applies the `--restart=unless-stopped` policy to the container, telling Docker to restart the container if it exits unexpectadly.

2. Start a `redis` container on `frontend01` and `frontend02`

        $ sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped --env="constraint:node==frontend01" -p 6379:6379 --name redis01 --net mynet -d redis

        $ sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped --env="constraint:node==frontend02" -p 6379:6379 --name redis02 --net mynet -d redis

    These two commands are issued against the Swarm cluster. The commands specify *node constraints*, forcing Swarm to start the contaienrs on `frontend01` and `frontend02`. Port 6379 on each instance is mapped to port 6379 inside of each container for debugging purposes. The command also applies the `--restart=unless-stopped` policy to the containers and attaches them to the `mynet` overlay network.

3. Start a `web-vote-app` container on `frontend01` and `frontend02`

        $ sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped --env="constraint:node==frontend01" -d -p 5000:80 -e WEB_VOTE_NUMBER='01' --name frontend01 --net mynet --hostname votingapp.local web-vote-app

        $ sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped --env="constraint:node==frontend02" -d -p 5000:80 -e WEB_VOTE_NUMBER='02' --name frontend02 --net mynet --hostname votingapp.local web-vote-app

    These two commands are issued against the Swarm cluster. The commands specify *node constraints*, forcing Swarm to start the contaienrs on `frontend01` and `frontend02`. Port 5000 on each node is mapped to port 80 inside of each container. This allows connections to come in to each node on port 5000 and be forwarded to port 80 inside of each container. Both containers are attached to the `mynet` overlay network and both containers are given the `votingapp-local` hostname. The `--restart=unless-stopped` policy is also applied to these containers.

4. Start the `postgres` container on the `store` node

        $ sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped --env="constraint:node==store" --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pg8675309 --net mynet -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

    This command is issued against the Swarm cluster and starts the container on `store`. It maps port 5432 on the `store` node to port 5432 inside the container and attaches the container to the `mynet` overlay network. It also inserts the database password into the container via the POSTGRES_PASSWORD environment variable and applies the `--restart=unless-stopped` policy to the container. Sharing passwords like this is not recommended for production use cases.

5. Start the `worker01` container on the `worker01` node

        $ sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped --env="constraint:node==worker01" -d -e WORKER_NUMBER='01' -e FROM_REDIS_HOST=1 -e TO_REDIS_HOST=2 --name worker01 --net mynet vote-worker

    This command is issued against the Swarm manager and uses a constraint to start the container on the `worker01` node. It passes configuration data into the container via environment variables, telling the worker container to clear the queues on `frontend01` and `frontend02`. It adds the container to the `mynet` overlay network and applies the `--restart=unless-stopped` policy to the container.

6. Start the `results-app` container on the `store` node

        $ sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped --env="constraint:node==store" -p 80:80 -d --name results-app --net mynet results-app

    This command starts the results-app container on the `store` node by means of a *node constraint*. It maps port 80 on the `store` node to port 80 inside the container. It adds the container to the `mynet` overlay network and applies the `--restart=unless-stopped` policy to the container.

The application is now fully deployed as shown in the diagram below.

![](images/fully-deployed.jpg)

## Test the application

Now that the application is deployed and running, it's time to test it.

1. Configure a DNS mapping on your local machine for browsing.

    You configure a DNS mapping on the machine where you are running your web browser. This maps the "votingapp.local" DNS name to the public IP address of the `interlock` node.

    - On Windows machines this is done by adding `votingapp.local <interlock-public-ip>` to the `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts file`. Modifying this file requires administrator privileges. To open the file with administrator privileges, right-click `C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe` and select `Run as administrator`. Once Notepad is open, click `file` > `open` and open the file and make the edit.
    - On OSX machines this is done by adding `votingapp.local <interlock-public-ip>` to `/private/etc/hosts`.
    - On most Linux machines this is done by adding `votingapp.local <interlock-public-ip>` to `/etc/hosts`.

    Be sure to replace <interlock-public-ip> with the public IP address of your `interlock` node. You can find the `interlock` node's Public IP by selecting your `interlock` EC2 Instance from within the AWS EC2 console.

2. Verify the mapping worked with a ping command from your web browsers machine

        C:\Users\nigelpoulton>ping votingapp.local
        Pinging votingapp.local [54.183.164.230] with 32 bytes of data:
        Reply from 54.183.164.230: bytes=32 time=164ms TTL=42
        Reply from 54.183.164.230: bytes=32 time=163ms TTL=42
        Reply from 54.183.164.230: bytes=32 time=169ms TTL=42

3. Now that name resolution is configured and you have successfully pinged `votingapp.local`, point your web browser to [http://votingapp.local](http://votingapp.local)

    ![](images/vote-app-test.jpg)

    Notice the text at the bottom of the web page. This shows which web
    container serviced the request. In the diagram above, this is `frontend02`.
    If you refresh your web browser you should see this change as the Interlock
    load balancer shares incoming requests across both web containers.

    To see more detailed load balancer data from the Interlock service, point your web browser to [http://stats:interlock@votingapp.local/haproxy?stats](http://stats:interlock@votingapp.local/haproxy?stats)

4. Cast your vote. It is recommended to choose "Dogs" ;-)

5. To see the results of the poll, you can point your web browser at the public IP of the `store` node

Congratulations. You have successfully walked through manually deploying a microservice-based application to a Swarm cluster.

## Troubleshooting the application

It's a fact of life that things fail. With this in mind, it's important to
understand what happens when failures occur and how to mitigate them. The
following sections cover different failure scenarios:

- [Swarm manager failures](#swarm-manager-failures)
- [Consul (discovery backend) failures](#consul-discovery-backend-failures)
- [Interlock load balancer failures](#interlock-load-balancer-failures)
- [Web (web-vote-app) failures](#web-web-vote-app-failures)
- [Redis failures](#redis-failures)
- [Worker (vote-worker) failures](#worker-vote-worker-failures)
- [Postgres failures](#postgres-failures)
- [Results-app failures](#results-app-failures)
- [Infrastructure failures](#infrastructure-failures)

### Swarm manager failures

In it's current configuration, the Swarm cluster only has single manager
container running on a single node. If the container exits or the node fails,
you will not be able to administer the cluster until you either; fix it, or
replace it.

If the failure is the Swarm manager container unexpectedly exiting, Docker will
automatically attempt to restart it. This is because the container was started
with the `--restart=unless-stopped` switch.

While the Swarm manager is unavailable, the application will continue to work in
its current configuration. However, you will not be able to provision more nodes
or containers until you have a working Swarm manager.

Docker Swarm supports high availability for Swarm managers. This allows a single
Swarm cluster to have two or more managers. One manager is elected as the
primary manager and all others operate as secondaries. In the event that the
primary manager fails, one of the secondaries is elected as the new primary, and
cluster operations continue gracefully. If you are deploying multiple Swarm
managers for high availability, you should consider spreading them across
multiple failure domains within your infrastructure.

### Consul (discovery backend) failures

The Swarm cluster that you have deployed has a single Consul container on a
single node performing the cluster discovery service. In this setup, if the
Consul container exits or the node fails, the application will continue to
operate in its current configuration. However, certain cluster management
operations will fail. These include registering new containers in the cluster
and making lookups against the cluster configuration.

If the failure is the `consul` container unexpectedly exiting, Docker will
automatically attempt to restart it. This is because the container was started
with the `--restart=unless-stopped` switch.

The `Consul`, `etcd`, and `Zookeeper` discovery service backends support various
options for high availability. These include Paxos/Raft quorums. You should
follow existing best practices for deploying HA configurations of your chosen
discover service backend. If you are deploying multiple discovery service
instances for high availability, you should consider spreading them across
multiple failure domains within your infrastructure.

If you operate your Swarm cluster with a single discovery backend service and
this service fails and is unrecoverable, you can start a new empty instance of
the discovery backend and the Swarm agents on each node in the cluster will
repopulate it.


#### Handling failures

There are many reasons why containers can fail. However, Swarm does not attempt
to restart failed containers.

One way to automatically restart failed containers is to explicitly start them
with the `--restart=unless-stopped` flag. This will tell the local Docker daemon
to attempt to restart the container if it unexpectedly exits. This will only
work in situations where the node hosting the container and it's Docker daemon
are still up. This cannot restart a container if the node hosting it has failed,
or if the Docker daemon itself has failed.

Another way is to have an external tool (external to the cluster) monitor the
state of your application, and make sure that certain service levels are
maintained. These service levels can include things like "have at least 10 web
server containers running". In this scenario, if the number of web containers
drops below 10, the tool will attempt to start more.

In our simple voting-app example, the front-end is scalable and serviced by a
load balancer. In the event that on the of the two web containers fails (or the
AWS instance that is hosting it), the load balancer will stop routing requests
to it and send all requests the surviving web container. This solution is highly
scalable meaning you can have up to *n* web containers behind the load balancer.

### Interlock load balancer failures

The environment that you have provisioned has a single
[interlock](https://github.com/ehazlett/interlock) load balancer container
running on a single node. In this setup, if the container exits or node fails,
the application will no longer be able to service incoming requests and the
application will be unavailable.

If the failure is the `interlock` container unexpectedly exiting, Docker will
automatically attempt to restart it. This is because the container was started
with the `--restart=unless-stopped` switch.

It is possible to build an HA Interlock load balancer configuration. One such
way is to have multiple Interlock containers on multiple nodes. You can then use
DNS round robin, or other technologies, to load balance across each Interlock
container. That way, if one Interlock container or node goes down, the others
will continue to service requests.

If you deploy multiple interlock load balancers, you should consider spreading
them across multiple failure domains within your infrastructure.

### Web (web-vote-app) failures

The environment that you have configured has two web-vote-app containers running
on two separate nodes. They operate behind an Interlock load balancer that
distributes incoming connections across both.

In the event that one of the web containers or nodes fails, the load balancer
will start directing all incoming requests to surviving instance. Once the
failed instance is back up, or a replacement is added, the load balancer will
add it to the configuration and start sending a portion of the incoming requests
to it.

For highest availability you should deploy the two frontend web services
(`frontend01` and `frontend02`) in different failure zones within your
infrastructure. You should also consider deploying more.

### Redis failures

If the a `redis` container fails, it's partnered `web-vote-app` container will
not function correctly. The best solution in this instance might be to configure
health monitoring that verifies the ability to write to each Redis instance. If
an unhealthy `redis` instance is encountered, remove the `web-vote-app` and
`redis` combination and attempt remedial actions.

### Worker (vote-worker) failures

If the worker container exits, or the node that is hosting it fails, the redis
containers will queue votes until the worker container comes back up. This
situation can prevail indefinitely, though a worker needs to come back at some
point and process the votes.

If the failure is the `worker01` container unexpectedly exiting, Docker will
automatically attempt to restart it. This is because the container was started
with the `--restart=unless-stopped` switch.

### Postgres failures

This application does not implement any for of HA or replication for Postgres.
Therefore losing the Postgres container would cause the application to fail and
potential lose or corrupt data. A better solution would be to implement some
form of Postgres HA or replication.

### Results-app failures

If the results-app container exits, you will not be able to browse to the
results of the poll until the container is back up and running. Results will
continue to be collected and counted, you will just not be able to view results
until the container is back up and running.

The results-app container was started with the `--restart=unless-stopped` flag
meaning that the Docker daemon will automatically attempt to restart it unless
it was administratively stopped.

### Infrastructure failures

There are many ways in which the infrastructure underpinning your applications
can fail. However, there are a few best practices that can be followed to help
mitigate and offset these failures.

One of these is to deploy infrastructure components over as many failure domains
as possible. On a service such as AWS, this often translates into balancing
infrastructure and services across multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZ) within a
Region.

To increase the availability of our Swarm cluster you could:

* Configure the Swarm manager for HA and deploy HA nodes in different AZs
* Configure the Consul discovery service for HA and deploy HA nodes in different AZs
* Deploy all scalable components of the application across multiple AZs

This configuration is shown in the diagram below.

![](images/infrastructure-failures.jpg)

This will allow us to lose an entire AZ and still have our cluster and
application operate.

But it doesn't have to stop there. Some applications can be balanced across AWS
Regions. In our example we might deploy parts of our cluster and application in
the `us-west-1` Region and the rest in `us-east-1`. It's even becoming possible
to deploy services across cloud providers, or have balance services across
public cloud providers and your on premises date ceters!

The diagram below shows parts of the application and infrastructure deployed
across AWS and Microsoft Azure. But you could just as easily replace one of
those cloud providers with your own on premises data center. In these scenarios,
network latency and reliability is key to a smooth and workable solution.
