# Strategies README

The `Docker Swarm` scheduler comes with multiple strategies.  To read the
end-user strategy documentation, visit [the Swarm strategy documentation on
docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/scheduler/strategy/). If you want
to modify the filter documentation, start with [the `docs/scheduler`
directory](https://github.com/docker/swarm/blob/master/docs/scheduler/index.md)
in this project.
