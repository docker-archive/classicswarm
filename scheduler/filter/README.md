# Filters README

The `Docker Swarm` scheduler comes with multiple filters.  To read the end-user
filters documentation, visit [the Swarm API documentation on
docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/scheduler/filter/). If you want
to modify the filter documentation, start with [the `docs/scheduler`
directory](https://github.com/docker/swarm/blob/master/docs/scheduler/index.md)
in this project.
