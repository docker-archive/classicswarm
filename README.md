Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker. It turns a pool of Docker hosts
into a single, virtual host.

Swarm serves the standard Docker API, so any tool which already communicates
with a Docker daemon can use Swarm to transparently scale to multiple hosts:
Dokku, Compose, Krane, Flynn, Deis, DockerUI, Shipyard, Drone, Jenkins... and,
of course, the Docker client itself.

Like other Docker projects, Swarm follows the "batteries included but removable"
principle. It ships with a set of simple scheduling backends out of the box, and as
initial development settles, an API will be developed to enable pluggable backends.
The goal is to provide a smooth out-of-the-box experience for simple use cases, and
allow swapping in more powerful backends, like Mesos, for large scale production
deployments.

## Installation for Swarm Users

For instructions on using Swarm in your dev, test or production environment, refer to the Docker Swarm documentation on [docs.docker.com](http://docs.docker.com/swarm/).

## Building Swarm from Source

To compile Swarm from source code, refer to the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](http://github.com/docker/swarm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Participating
