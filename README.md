# Libswarm

## A minimalist toolkit to compose network services


*libswarm* is a minimalist toolkit to compose network services.

It exposes a simple API for the following tasks:

* *Clustering*: deploy services on pools of interchangeable machines
* *Composition*: combine multiple services into higher-level services of arbitrary complexity - it's services all the way down!
* *Interconnection*: services can reliably and securely communicate with each other using asynchronous message passing, request/response, or raw sockets.
* *Scale* services can run concurrently in the same process using goroutines and channels; in separate processes on the same machines using high-performance IPC;
on multiple machines in a local network; or across multiple datacenters.
* *Integration*: incorporate your existing systems into your swarm. libswarm includes adapters to many popular infrastructure tools and services: docker, dns, mesos, etcd, fleet, deis, google compute, rackspace cloud, tutum, orchard, digital ocean, ssh, etc. Itâ€™s very easy to create your own adapter: just clone the repository at 


## Adapters

Libswarm supports the following adapters:

### Debug adapter

The debug backend simply catches all messages and prints them on the terminal for inspection.

## Testing libswarm with swarmd

Libswarm ships with a simple daemon which can control all machines in your distributed
system using a variety of backend adaptors, and exposes it on a single, unified endpoint.

Usage example:


Run swarmd without arguments to list available backends:

```
./swarmd
```

Pass a backend name as argument to load it:

```
./swarmd fakeclient
```

You can pass arguments to the backend, like a shell command:

```
./swarmd 'dockerserver tcp://localhost:4243'
```

You can call multiple backends. They will be executed in parallel, with the output
of each backend connected to the input of the next, just like unix pipelines.

This allows for very powerful composition.

```
./swarmd 'dockerserver tcp://localhost:4243' 'debug' 'dockerclient unix:///var/run/docker.sock'
```
