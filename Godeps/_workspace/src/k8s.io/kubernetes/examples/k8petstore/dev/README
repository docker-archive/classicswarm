### Local development 

1) Install Go

2) Install Redis

Now start a local redis instance 

```sh
redis-server
```

And run the app 

```sh
export GOPATH=~/Development/k8hacking/k8petstore/web-server/
cd $GOPATH/src/main/
## Now, you're in the local dir to run the app.  Go get its depenedencies.
go get
go run PetStoreBook.go
```

Once the app works the way you want it to, test it in the vagrant recipe below.  This will guarantee that you're local environment isn't doing something that breaks the containers at the  versioning level.

### Testing 

This folder can be used by anyone interested in building and developing the k8petstore application.

This is for dev and test.

`vagrant up` gets you a cluster with the app's core components running.

You can rename Vagrantfile_atomic to Vagrantfile if you want to try to test in atomic instead.

** Now you can run the code on the kubernetes cluster with reasonable assurance that any problems you run into are not bugs in the code itself :) *
