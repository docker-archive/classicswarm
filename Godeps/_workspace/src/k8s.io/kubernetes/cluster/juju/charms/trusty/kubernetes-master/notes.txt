notes on src
------------
   current provider responsibilities
    - instances
    - load blanacers
    - zones (not useful as its only for apiserver).

   provider functionality currently hardcoded to gce across codebase
    - persistent storage


ideas
-----
 - juju provider impl
 - file provider for machines/minions
 - openvpn as overlay per extant salt config.

cloud
-----

todo
----
 - token auth file
   - format csv ->  token, user, uid
 - config privileged
 - config log-level
 - config / check logs collection endpoint
 - config / version and binary location via url

Q. The new volumes/storage provider api appears to be hardcoded to
gce.. Is there a plan to abstract that anytime soon?  
A. effectively it is abstract enough for the moment, no plans to
change, but willing subject to suitable abstraction.

Q.The zone provider api appears to return the address only of the api
server afaics. How is that useful? afaics the better semantic would be
an attribute on the minions to instantiate multiple templates across
zones?
A. apparently not considered, current solution for ha is multiple k8s
per zone with external lb. pointed out this was inane.


Q. Several previous platforms supported have been moved to the icebox,
just curious what was subject to bitrot. the salt/shell script for
those platforms or something more api intrinsic?
A. apparently the change to ship binaries instead of build from src
broke them.. somehow.

Q. i'm mostly interested in flannel due to its portability. Does the
inter pod networking setup need to include the other components of the
system, ie does api talk directly to containers, or only via kubelet.
A. api server only talks to kubelet


Q. Status of HA?
A. not done yet, election package merged, nothing using it.

Afaics design discussion doesn't take place on the list.

Q. Is minion registration supported, ie. bypassing cloud provider
filter all instances via regex match?
A. not done yet, pull request in review for minions in etcd (not
found, perhaps merged)
