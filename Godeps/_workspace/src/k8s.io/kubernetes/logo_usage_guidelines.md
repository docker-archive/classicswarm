# Kubernetes Branding Guidelines

These guidelines provide you with guidance for using the Kubernetes logo. You can use the logo on your website or in print without pre-approval, provided you follow these basic guidelines.

You may display, modify or use the Kubernetes logo only in connection with compliant implementations of Kubernetes and related uses in the following ways.  A compliant implementation is an implementation of the unmodified Google version of Kubernetes found at https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes and compatible branches thereof, together with published specifications, APIs and operational patterns. Â Acceptable related uses include display, modify or use of the Kubernetes logo in connection with your compliant implementation, your integration with a compliant implementation, your support for a compliant implementation, your Kubernetes-compatible product, or in collateral, presentations, and marketing materials relating to compliant implementations of Kubernetes.

Use of the Kubernetes logo or other Google brands in ways not expressly covered by this document is not allowed without prior written consent from Google -- see Google's [Guidelines for Third Party Use of Google Brand Features](http://www.google.com/intl/en/permissions/guidelines.html) for more information.
