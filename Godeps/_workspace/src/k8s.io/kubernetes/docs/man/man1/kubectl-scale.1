.SH NAME
.PP
kubectl scale \- Set a new size for a Replication Controller.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkubectl scale\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Set a new size for a Replication Controller.

.PP
Scale also allows users to specify one or more preconditions for the scale action.
If \-\-current\-replicas or \-\-resource\-version is specified, it is validated before the
scale is attempted, and it is guaranteed that the precondition holds true when the
scale is sent to the server.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-current\-replicas\fP=\-1
    Precondition for current size. Requires that the current size of the replication controller match this value in order to scale.

.PP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-filename\fP=[]
    Filename, directory, or URL to a file identifying the replication controller to set a new size

.PP
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP=""
    Output mode. Use "\-o name" for shorter output (resource/name).

.PP
\fB\-\-replicas\fP=\-1
    The new desired number of replicas. Required.

.PP
\fB\-\-resource\-version\fP=""
    Precondition for resource version. Requires that the current resource version match this value in order to scale.

.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\fP=0
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a scale operation, zero means don't wait.

.nf
# Scale replication controller named 'foo' to 3.
$ kubectl scale \-\-replicas=3 replicationcontrollers foo

# Scale a replication controller identified by type and name specified in "foo\-controller.yaml" to 3.
$ kubectl scale \-\-replicas=3 \-f foo\-controller.yaml

# If the replication controller named foo's current size is 2, scale foo to 3.
$ kubectl scale \-\-current\-replicas=2 \-\-replicas=3 replicationcontrollers foo

# Scale multiple replication controllers.
$ kubectl scale \-\-replicas=5 rc/foo rc/bar
