GitHub Issues for the Kubernetes Project
========================================

A list quick overview of how we will review and prioritize incoming issues at https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues

Priorities
----------

We will use GitHub issue labels for prioritization.  The absence of a priority label means the bug has not been reviewed and prioritized yet.

Definitions
-----------
* P0 - something broken for users, build broken, or critical security issue.  Someone must drop everything and work on it.
* P1 - must fix for earliest possible binary release (every two weeks)
* P2 - should be fixed in next major release version
* P3 - default priority for lower importance bugs that we still want to track and plan to fix at some point
* design - priority/design is for issues that are used to track design discussions
* support - priority/support is used for issues tracking user support requests
* untriaged - anything without a priority/X label will be considered untriaged
