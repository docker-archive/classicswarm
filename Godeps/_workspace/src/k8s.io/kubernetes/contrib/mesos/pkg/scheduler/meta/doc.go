// Package meta defines framework constants used as keys in k8s annotations
// that are attached to k8s pods. The scheduler uses some of these annotations
// for reconciliation upon failover. Other annotations are used as part of
// the host-to-pod port-mapping implementation understood by the k8s-mesos
// scheduler and custom endpoints-controller implementation.
