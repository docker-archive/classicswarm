# When run as described below, the conformance test tests whether a cluster
# supports key features for Kubernetes version 1.0.

# Instructions:
#  - Setup a Kubernetes cluster with $NUM_MINIONS nodes (defined below).
#  - Provide a Kubeconfig file whose current context is set to the
#    cluster to be tested, and with suitable auth setting.
#  - Specify the location of that kubeconfig with, e.g.:
#    declare -x KUBECONFIG="$HOME/.kube/config"
#  - Make sure only essential pods are running and there are no failed/pending pods.
#  - Go to a git tree that contains the kubernetes source.
#    - git clone git://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.git
#  - Checkout the upstream/conformance-test-v1 branch
#    - git checkout upstream/conformance-test-v1
#    - The working tree will be in a "detached HEAD" state.
#  - Make binaries needed by e2e
#      make clean
#      make quick-release
#  - Run the test and capture output:
#      hack/conformance-test.sh 2>&1 | tee conformance.$(date +%FT%T%z).log
#

# About the conformance test:
# The conformance test checks whether a kubernetes cluster supports
# a minimum set of features to be called "Kubernetes".  It is similar
# to `hack/e2e-test.sh` but it differs in that:
#  - hack/e2e-test.sh is intended to test a cluster with binaries built at HEAD,
#    while this conformance test does not care what version the binaries are.
#    - this means the user needs to setup a cluster first.
#    - this means the user does not need to write any cluster/... scripts.  Custom
#      clusters can be tested.
#  - hack/e2e-test.sh is intended to run e2e tests built at HEAD, while
#    this conformance test is intended to be run e2e tests built at a particular
#    version.  This ensures that all conformance testees run the same set of tests,
#    regardless of when they test for conformance.
#  - it excludes certain e2e tests:
#    - tests that are specific to certain cloud providers
#    - tests of optional features, such as volume types.
#    - tests of performance, scale, or reliability
#    - known flaky tests.
# TODO: when preparing to release a new major or minor version of Kubernetes,
# create a new conformance-test-vX.Y branch, update mentions of that branch in this file,
# reevaluate the set of e2e tests,
# update documentation at docs/getting-started-guides/README.md to have
# a new column for conformance at that new version, and notify
# community.
