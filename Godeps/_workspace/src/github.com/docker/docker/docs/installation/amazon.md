## Amazon EC2

You can install Docker on any AWS EC2 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) which runs an
operating system that Docker supports. Amazon's website includes specific
instructions for [installing on Amazon
Linux](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html#install_docker). To install on
another AMI, follow the instructions for its specific operating
system in this installation guide. 

For detailed information on Amazon AWS support for Docker, refer to [Amazon's
documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html).
