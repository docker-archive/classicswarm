# events

    Usage: docker events [OPTIONS]

    Get real time events from the server

      -f, --filter=[]    Filter output based on conditions provided
      --help=false       Print usage
      --since=""         Show all events created since timestamp
      --until=""         Stream events until this timestamp

Docker containers will report the following events:

    attach, commit, copy, create, destroy, die, exec_create, exec_start, export, kill, oom, pause, rename, resize, restart, start, stop, top, unpause

and Docker images will report:

    delete, import, pull, push, tag, untag

The `--since` and `--until` parameters can be Unix timestamps, RFC3339
dates or Go duration strings (e.g. `10m`, `1h30m`) computed relative to
client machineâ€™s time. If you do not provide the --since option, the command
returns only new and/or live events.

## Filtering

The filtering flag (`-f` or `--filter`) format is of "key=value". If you would
like to use multiple filters, pass multiple flags (e.g.,
`--filter "foo=bar" --filter "bif=baz"`)

Using the same filter multiple times will be handled as a *OR*; for example
`--filter container=588a23dac085 --filter container=a8f7720b8c22` will display
events for container 588a23dac085 *OR* container a8f7720b8c22

Using multiple filters will be handled as a *AND*; for example
`--filter container=588a23dac085 --filter event=start` will display events for
container container 588a23dac085 *AND* the event type is *start*

The currently supported filters are:

* container (`container=<name or id>`)
* event (`event=<event type>`)
* image (`image=<tag or id>`)
* label (`label=<key>` or `label=<key>=<value>`)

## Examples

You'll need two shells for this example.

**Shell 1: Listening for events:**

    $ docker events

**Shell 2: Start and Stop containers:**

    $ docker start 4386fb97867d
    $ docker stop 4386fb97867d
    $ docker stop 7805c1d35632

**Shell 1: (Again .. now showing events):**

**Show events in the past from a specified time:**

This example outputs all events that were generated in the last 3 minutes,
relative to the current time on the client machine:

    $ docker events --since '3m'
