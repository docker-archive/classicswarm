# Coding style checklist

This checklist summarizes the material you experienced working through [make a
code contribution](make-a-contribution.md) and [advanced
contributing](advanced-contributing.md). The checklist applies to both 
program code and documentation code.

## Change and commit code

* Fork the `docker/docker` repository.

* Make changes on your fork in a feature branch. Name your branch `XXXX-something`
  where `XXXX` is the issue number you are working on.

* Run `gofmt -s -w file.go` on each changed file before
  committing your changes. Most editors have plug-ins that do this automatically.

* Run `golint` on each changed file before
  committing your changes.

* Update the documentation when creating or modifying features. 

* Commits that fix or close an issue should reference them in the commit message
  `Closes #XXXX` or `Fixes #XXXX`. Mentions help by automatically closing the
  issue on a merge.

* After every commit, run the test suite and ensure it is passing.

* Sync and rebase frequently as you code to keep up with `docker` master.

* Set your `git` signature and make sure you sign each commit.

* Do not add yourself to the `AUTHORS` file. This file is autogenerated from the
  Git history.

## Tests and testing

* Submit unit tests for your changes. 

* Make use of the builtin Go test framework built. 

* Use existing Docker test files (`name_test.go`) for inspiration. 

* Run <a href="../test-and-docs" target="_blank">the full test suite</a> on your
  branch before submitting a pull request.

* Run `make docs` to build the documentation and then check it locally.

* Use an <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com" target="_blank">online grammar
  checker</a> or similar to test you documentation changes for clarity,
  concision, and correctness.

## Pull requests

* Sync and cleanly rebase on top of Docker's `master` without multiple branches
  mixed into the PR.

* Before the pull request, squash your commits into logical units of work using
  `git rebase -i` and `git push -f`. 

* Include documentation changes in the same commit so that a revert would
  remove all traces of the feature or fix.

* Reference each issue in your pull request description (`#XXXX`)

## Respond to pull requests reviews 

* Docker maintainers use LGTM (**l**ooks-**g**ood-**t**o-**m**e) in PR comments
  to indicate acceptance.

* Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make
  the suggested modifications and push additional commits to your feature
  branch.

* Incorporate changes on your feature branch and push to your fork. This
  automatically updates your open pull request.

* Post a comment after pushing to alert reviewers to PR changes; pushing a
  change does not send notifications.

* A change requires LGTMs from an absolute majority maintainers of an
  affected component. For example, if you change `docs/` and `registry/` code,
  an absolute majority of the `docs/` and the `registry/` maintainers must
  approve your PR.

## Merges after pull requests

* After a merge, [a master build](https://master.dockerproject.org/) is
  available almost immediately.

* If you made a documentation change, you can see it at
  [docs.master.dockerproject.org](http://docs.master.dockerproject.org/).
