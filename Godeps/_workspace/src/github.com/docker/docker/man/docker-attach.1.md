# NAME
docker-attach - Attach to a running container

# SYNOPSIS
**docker attach**
[**--help**]
[**--no-stdin**[=*false*]]
[**--sig-proxy**[=*true*]]
CONTAINER

# DESCRIPTION
The **docker attach** command allows you to attach to a running container using
the container's ID or name, either to view its ongoing output or to control it
interactively.  You can attach to the same contained process multiple times
simultaneously, screen sharing style, or quickly view the progress of your
daemonized process.

You can detach from the container (and leave it running) with `CTRL-p CTRL-q`
(for a quiet exit) or `CTRL-c` which will send a `SIGKILL` to the container.
When you are attached to a container, and exit its main process, the process's
exit code will be returned to the client.

It is forbidden to redirect the standard input of a `docker attach` command while
attaching to a tty-enabled container (i.e.: launched with `-t`).

# OPTIONS
**--help**
  Print usage statement

**--no-stdin**=*true*|*false*
   Do not attach STDIN. The default is *false*.

**--sig-proxy**=*true*|*false*
   Proxy all received signals to the process (non-TTY mode only). SIGCHLD, SIGKILL, and SIGSTOP are not proxied. The default is *true*.

# EXAMPLES

## Attaching to a container

In this example the top command is run inside a container, from an image called
fedora, in detached mode. The ID from the container is passed into the **docker
attach** command:

    # ID=$(sudo docker run -d fedora /usr/bin/top -b)
    # sudo docker attach $ID
