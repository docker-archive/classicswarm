	# The curators help ensure that incoming issues and pull requests are properly triaged and
	# that our various contribution and reviewing processes are respected. With their knowledge of
	# the repository activity, they can also guide contributors to relevant material or
	# discussions.
	#
	# They are neither code nor docs reviewers, so they are never expected to merge. They can
	# however:
	# - close an issue or pull request when it's an exact duplicate
	# - close an issue or pull request when it's inappropriate or off-topic
